  message: <<EOM
If you are running Cassandra manually, as opposed to enabling the daemon, remember to create the data and log directories.
These directories must be accessible to the cassandra user.
The default data directory will be created by the database in '/var/db/cassandra', which is already initialized during installation as the 'cassandra' user's home directory.
The default log directory is '/var/log/cassandra' and must be created with the correct permissions by you.
