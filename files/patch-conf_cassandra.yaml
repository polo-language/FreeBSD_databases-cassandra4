 # Row cache implementation class name. Available implementations:

-# org.apache.cassandra.cache.OHCProvider
-#   Fully off-heap row cache implementation (default).

 # org.apache.cassandra.cache.SerializingCacheProvider
 #   This is the row cache implementation availabile

 # Maximum size of the row cache in memory.
-# Please note that OHC cache implementation requires some additional off-heap memory to manage
-# the map structures and some in-flight memory during operations before/after cache entries can be
-# accounted against the cache capacity. This overhead is usually small compared to the whole capacity.
-# Do not specify more memory that the system can afford in the worst usual situation and leave some
-# headroom for OS block level cache. Do never allow your system to swap.
 #
 # Default value is 0, to disable row caching.
